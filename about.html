        <h1>Water Filter Buying Guide</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Tom and I created this website to help
        people be more informed of how to buy the right water filter
        for their homes. </p>
        
        <p>This guide currently is still in development. I 
        am still learning more about how to carry all the designs
        and information onto the website. Once it is more polished, I 
        hope you will find the information here easy to understand
        and informative about water problems as well as 
        water filters you may need.</p>
        <p>If you need more information about water filters or have comments
        about this website, feel free to <a href = "contact.html">
        send me an email</a>! </p>
