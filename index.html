        <h1>Water Filter Buying Guide</h1>
        <h2>Knowledge Keeps Your Water Safe</h2>
        
        <p>Welcome to your water filter buying guide. On this website you will find useful information about why and how to buy a water filter for your home!</p>
        
        <h3>Why do you need a water filter?</h3>
        <p><strong>Just because water taste good does not mean it is good for your health.</strong><br>
        Even if water looks, smells, and tastes just fine, it can still be contaminated because microbial and organic contaminants cannot always be deteched by human senses.
        </p>
        <p>Harmful particles such as dirt, bacteria and chemicals can come from many places, from your home's old pipes to nearby agriculture area and factories.</p>
        
        <h3>Does every water filter do the job?</h3>
        <p><strong>Unfortunately, no water filter is perfect.</strong><br>
        Each water filter is effective against certain contaminants but ineffective against others. It is important to understand what contaminants are in your drinking water to buy the right filter.
        </p>
